# CSS building blocks

This module carries on where CSS first steps left off â€” now that you've gained familiarity with the language and its syntax, and got some basic experience using it, it's time to dive a bit deeper. This module looks at the cascade and inheritance, all the selector types we have available, units, sizing, styling backgrounds and borders, debugging, and lots more.
